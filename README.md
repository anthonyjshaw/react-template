# React Template

## About


This is a stripped down React template to help web development beginners get started with React.

While using the create-react-app command is a great way to quickly obtain a functional React application straight out of the box, sometimes you may only want the bare essentials.

This template comes with a basic webpack server, Sass and an initial App component.

To get started, clone the repo and cd into the directory:

```
git clone git@github.com:anthonyjshaw/react-template.git <your-react-project-name>

cd <your-react-project-name>
```

Install any dependencies by running the ```yarn install``` command.

Start the development server by running the command:

```
yarn start
```

And finally, press Ctrl+C to end the server.

Enjoy!
